			<td><p style="color: #568259;">The main character, Phosphophyllite, is introduced as a happy-go-lucky gem person! They start off weak but they always want to help out in fights. Because of this, they change themselves to become stronger, but at what cost?</p></td>

			<td><p style="color: #E34234;">My favourite gem is Cinnabar, a character who, by the other characters (including themselves) is dangerous due to their power. By physical strength, they are by far the weakest among all metals because they are the only one that is naturally in liquid form.</p></td>

			<td><p>Diamond, or Dia, is very friendly, often associating things to love. They are one of the most strongest gems due to their material. They often blind people with their brightness and prettiness.</p></td>
